# 2024 Robot

## Robot Programming Setup

### Install Development Software and Clone the Code

1. Download and install the WPILib version of VS Code along with other FRC Java tools using [these instructions](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/wpilib-setup.html). While you're there, please bookmark the main page of [docs.wpilib.org](https://docs.wpilib.org/). There's a lot of information about FRC software and electronics here.
2. Download and install [Git](https://git-scm.com/).
3. Open `2024 WPILib VS Code` using the desktop shortcut or start menu entry.
4. Copy the URL of this repository `https://github.com/superhornets/2024-Robot.git` to your computer's clipboard.
5. In VS Code, press your `F1` key to open the "Command Palette".
6. In the command palette, type `clone` and select `Git: Clone`.
7. Paste the URL of this repository and press your enter key.
8. Select a folder on your computer where you would like the `2024-Robot` folder created for you. The code (multiple files) will be cloned into the new folder. `Desktop` is probably a decent choice.
9. Click "Open in New Window".

### Reopening the Project

Opening VS Code will automatically reopen whatever project you last had open. If that's not the project you want, go to `File -> New Window`, click `Open Folder...` and select the folder of the project you want.

## Hardware configuration utilities

Download and install each of these as they are needed for configuring hardware components. Unless you are setting up a computer that you will not be bringing to the shop in which case these are mostly pointless.

* [REV Hardware Client](https://docs.revrobotics.com/rev-hardware-client) for configuring the SPARK MAX motor controllers.
* [FRC Game Tools](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/frc-game-tools.html) has the FRC Driver Station, Shuffleboard, and roboRIO Imaging Tool.
* [AdvantageKit](https://github.com/Mechanical-Advantage/AdvantageKit/releases/latest) for viewing logs.
* [Radio Configuration Utility](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/step-3/radio-programming.html) for configuring the Radio.
* [PhotonVision](https://photonvision.org/)

## Additional software for editing the code

* [PathPlanner](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9nqbkb5dw909) for editing autonomous routines.

## Helpful Git Programs

Git is the underlying command line program that does version control. Git can be complicated at times. You may find these programs helpful.

* VS Code Extension called `Git Graph` by mhutchie.
* [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
* [Git Extensions](https://gitextensions.github.io/)
